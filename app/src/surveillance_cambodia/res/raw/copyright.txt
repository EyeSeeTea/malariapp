The Electronic Data System (EDS) is intended to improve use of the on-site training and supportive supervision (OTSS) approach, in which MalariaCare supports government supervisors at the national, regional, and local levels to visit health facilities and observe malaria diagnosis and treatment practices, identify any gaps, and guide improvement. MalariaCare is a five-year partnership funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), with the goal of scaling up high-quality diagnosis and case management services for malaria and other febrile (fever-causing) illnesses.
