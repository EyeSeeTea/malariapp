<p>This Software Application (“App”) was developed by Population Services International (PSI) in collaboration with Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) to improve use of the on-site training and supportive supervision (OTSS) approach, in which MalariaCare supports government supervisors at the national, regional, and local levels to visit health facilities and observe malaria diagnosis and treatment practices, identify any gaps, and guide improvement.</p>

<p>This App is made possible by the generous support of the American People through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The contents are the responsibility of PSI and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government.</p>
